\index{secrets!split}

Splitting the editor window is a very useful feature whenever you are working with long and complex programs.
Go to the main bar, click on view/split. You may choose to split the window either horizontally or vertically.
You will get the same text on two different and independent windows.
Any change made in one window will be added automatically to the other and so to the text itself.
